Project DjangoDelights from codeacademy

  Django Delights is a project focused on developing an inventory and sales management application for a restaurant. Built using the Django framework in Python, the system allows users to manage stock, track sales, and generate performance reports. Key features include adding and updating inventory items, automatically adjusting stock levels after each sale, and assigning user roles with different access permissions. The project aims to streamline restaurant operations by providing an efficient tool for inventory control and sales reporting.
